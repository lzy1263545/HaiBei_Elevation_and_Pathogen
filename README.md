# HaiBei_Elevation_and_Pathogen
This repository contains published original data and R code.

Both the original data and R code were devided into two parts - "Haibei-Field-Study" and "Meta-analysis".
(i.e. four files attached in this repository named:
   1. "Haibei-Field-Study_Analysis.R": the R code for Haibei field study;
   2. "HaibeiData.xlsx": the original data of Haibei field study;
   3. "Meta_Elevation_Pathogen_Analysis.R": the R code for Meta-analysis;
   4. "MetaData.xlsx": the original data of Meta-analysis.)
Detailed annotations were attached in each of above four files

# For the original data of Haibei field study:
  Following data were contained - 1. elevation;
                                  2. plant community characteristics (only on community level);
                                  3. soil properties (only the first principle component of soil properites, Soil PCA1);
                                  4. environmental conditions;
                                  5. foliar fungal disease (only on community level);
                                  6. soil fungal pathogen related indices (only on community level).
                                  [for each of 30 plots in the experiment]
# For the original data of Meta-analysis:
  Following data were contained - 1. numbers of studies and papers;
                                  2. basic information of papers;
                                  3. ecological and geographical information of study site;
                                  4. ecological and geographical focuses of experimental design;
                                  5. statistical results for analysis.
                                  [for each of 62 studies included in the Meta-analysis]
